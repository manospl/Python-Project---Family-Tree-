# Python-Project---Family-Tree-
As of the first grade in the Open Hellenic University we had to create app that will help you build your family tree using python. 

So as to run the app you start python and first you run main.py which you will find into the build folder. 

Better run the GUI edition  (I added the other folders so as to see the progress)
